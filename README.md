Suckless Suite
==============
In this repository I keep a backup of my main DE (Desktop Enviroment). Its a fork of the following programs:

- dwm (Window Manager)
- dmenu (Dynamic Menu for dwm)
- st (Terminal)
- slstatus (Status monitor) 

They have been customized by manually or using patches provided by the original creators, Suckless.
